# Movies-ETL
## Project Overview
Used ETL(Extract,Transform,Load) to collect, Import, and Process Data.
The purpose is to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular so that the Amazon Prime Video, Streaming platform, can buy the streaming rights at a bargain.

We extracted the data from two sources, transformed it into one clean data set, and finally laod that data into a SQL table.

## Results
Used ETL process and code refactoring to write a function that reads in the three data files and creates three separate DataFrames.
