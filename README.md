# Movies-ETL
## Project Overview
Used ETL(Extract,Transform,Load) to collect, Import, and Process Data.
The purpose is to develop an alogrithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular so that the Amazon Prime Video, Streaming platform, can buy the streaming rights at a bargain.

We extracted the data from two sources, transformed it into one clean data set, and finally laod that data into a SQL table.
